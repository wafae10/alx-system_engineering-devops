Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: 2024-01-25 09:00 AM (UTC)
End Time: 2024-01-25 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact:
Service Affected: Web application login and authentication
User Experience: Users experienced login failures and delays, affecting approximately 30% of the user base.
Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the load balancer resulted in incorrect routing of authentication requests, causing authentication failures for a subset of users.
Timeline:

09:00 AM:
Detection: Increased error rates reported on the monitoring dashboard.
09:15 AM:
Issue Detection: Automated monitoring system triggered alerts for elevated error rates.
09:20 AM:
Initial Investigation: System engineers investigated server logs for anomalies.
09:45 AM:
Misleading Path: Initial assumption that the issue might be related to database connectivity problems; DBA team engaged.
10:00 AM:
Escalation: Issue escalated to the DevOps and Networking teams as login failures persisted.
10:30 AM:
Correct Path Identified: DevOps team identified load balancer misconfiguration impacting authentication traffic.
11:00 AM:
Resolution Action: Load balancer configuration corrected, and affected servers restarted.
11:30 AM:
Issue Resolved: Authentication services restored, error rates returned to normal.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The load balancer was misconfigured to route authentication requests to an incorrect server pool, resulting in authentication failures for affected users.
Resolution:
Load balancer configuration was corrected to properly route authentication traffic to the intended server pool. Affected servers were restarted to ensure consistent service.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
